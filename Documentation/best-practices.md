# Best Practices

This pattern is borrowed from [John Papa's Angular 1 Documentation](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).

## Use and Purpose

The purpose of a style guide is to provide guidance on building applications by showing the conventions used and, more importantly, why they were chosen.

That last part is important: it is not important to follow a guideline as much as it is to understand why people choose what they do; to shed some light on the challenges and solutions.

## What this Guide is Not

The style guide is not intended to serve as a demo of reusable code, code snippets, or advanced solutions though it may drop a few here or there. Rather it is intended to be a starting point for a team looking for consistency.
