## Design Guidelines

*These are not absolute rules*.

* `private` is better than not. If something isn't needed elsewhere, keep it local.
* Keep interfaces small.
* Encapsulated fields are good. Make fields `private` and only write setters that are needed.
* `final` fields are also good. If a field doesn't need to change, make it `final`.
