    Five Rules to Remember in Life:
    1. Forgive your enemy but remember their name.
    2. Money cannot buy happiness but it's more comfortable to cry in a Mercedes than on a bicycle.
    3. Help someone when they are in trouble and they will remember you when they are in trouble again.
    4. Many people are alive only because it's illegal to shoot them.
    5. Alcohol does not solve problems. But, then again, neither does milk.
    These should assist you with most daily decisions and choices.
