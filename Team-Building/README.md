    And have no idea
    What's going on.
    Is this my cup?
    I have to pee.

### [TBDM-0060]

    Never fight until you have to. But, when it's time to fight, fight like you're the third monkey on the ramp to Noah's Ark ... and brother, it's starting to rain.

### [TBDM-0061]

    If you think you are smarter than the previous generation, 50 years ago the owner's manual of a car showed you how to adjust the valves. Today, it warns you not to drink the contents of the battery.

### [TBDM-0062]

    I was in a meeting earlier where the room number was 404. I joked that I couldn't find the room and nobody understood. This is why I have such a hard time making friends.

### [TBDM-0066]

    I just want to know why my clothes only get stuck on the door handle when I'm in a bad mood.

### [TBDM-0067]

    Holy cr*p guys! I'm so lovable that the doctors gave me a special jacket so that I can hug myself!

### [TBDM-0068]

    Most people have "Ah-ha" moments. I mostly have "Oh, for f**k sake, are you kidding me?!?" moments.
