### Christmas

#### [TBDM-Christmas-001]

    Four stages of a man's life:
    1. You believe in Santa.
    2. You don't believe in Santa.
    3. You are Santa.
    4. You look like Santa.

#### [TBDM-Christmas-002]

    I'm no longer allowed to go caroling at the mental hospital. I guess "Do you hear what I hear" was a bad song choice.

#### [TBDM-Christmas-003]

    What do Santa's elves listen to while they work? Wrap music.

#### [TBDM-Christmas-004]

    Do not drink and wrap presents. Also, if someone gets a remove control for Christmas ... I'm going to need that back.

### New Year

    I was going to quit all my bad habits for the New Year, but then I remembered that nobody likes a quitter.

### [TBDM-007]

    Five Rules to Remember in Life:
    1. Forgive your enemy but remember their name.
    2. Money cannot buy happiness but it's more comfortable to cry in a Mercedes than on a bicycle.
    3. Help someone when they are in trouble and they will remember you when they are in trouble again.
    4. Many people are alive only because it's illegal to shoot them.
    5. Alcohol does not solve problems. But, then again, neither does milk.
    These should assist you with most daily decisions and choices.

### [TBDM-008]

    Just because I give you advice doesn't mean I am smarter than you.
    It just means I have done more stupid things than you.

### [TBDM-009]

    Linux Tip:
    Always remove the french language page:
    sudo rm -rf /*

### [TBDM-010]

    Thank you for not thinking I'm weird.
    I mean, we both know I'm weird, but you accept it and that makes me happy.

### [TBDM-011]

    Thursday.
    The most useless day. It only exists as a reminder that it's been a really long week ... and it's still not over.

### [TBDM-012]

    Being kissed while you're asleep is one of the purest forms of love ...
    Unless you're in prison.

### [TBDM-013]

    I'm at the age where my mind firmly believes I am 29, my humor suggest I'm 12, and my body died in the Civil War.

### [TBDM-014]

    I've reached the age where my train of thought often leaves the station without me ...

### [TBDM-015]

    "When in doubt, look intelligent." - Garrison Keillor

### [TBDM-016]

    Nothing says "I'm confused" like me trying to sleep in winter. Heat on, fan on, window cracked, under 13 quilts with one foot hanging out.

### [TBDM-017]

    I did some financial planning, and it looks like I can retire at 97 and live comfortably for about 11 minutes.

    Astronauts use Linux because you can't open windows in space.

    Breaking News! Police have confirmed that the man who tragically fell from the roof of an 18th floor night club was not a bouncer.

### [TBDM-020]

    Sometimes the thoughts in my head get so bored that they go for a stroll through my mouth. This is rarely a good thing.

### [TBDM-021]

    The best thing about me is that I'm a limited edition. There are no copies. And ... I bet right now you're thinking, "Thank God!"

### [TBDM-022]

    I tried donating blood today ... NEVER AGAIN! Too many stupid questions.
    * Who's blood is it?
    * Where did it come from?
    * Why is it in a bucket?

### [TBDM-023]

    Easily distrac ...

### [TBDM-024]

    I am not responsible for how you interpret what I say. That's between you and the squirrels fighting over the peanut in your head.

### [TBDM-025]

    Why would my own brain ruin my mood. Like, who's side are you on?

### [TBDM-026]

    The difference between me and Superman is that he has Super Vision and I require supervision.

### [TBDM-027]

    I tried to create a relaxing atmosphere in the office today by putting on a YouTube Fireplace Video. But, with the 8 large screens on the walls it looked like we were all in hell.

### [TBDM-028]

    Do you struggle with socializing? No. After years of intensive studying things like body language, tone, facial expressions, eye contact, and psychology while observing and copying my peers, I have created an adaptive script to follow. I am good at socializing.

### [TBDM-029]

    Have you ever noticed that everyone driving slower than you is an idiot? At the same time, everyone going faster than you is a maniac!

### [TBDM-030]

    Six was scared of seven because 7, 8, 9. But, why did seven eat nine? Because you're supposed to eat 3 squared meals a day.

### [TBDM-031]

    Somebody asked me, "what do you do with left over bacon?" I have never heard of that kind of bacon. Is it new?

    May the bridges I burn light the way!

    It's only delusional until it works.

### [TBDM-035]

    I have never been normal about a single thing, ever.

### [TBDM-036]

    Do you ever listen to a sing and remember exactly what life was like when you first heard it?

### [TBDM-037]

    I've never finished anything I've ever done. But, nothing I've ever done feels incomplete.

### [TBDM-038]

    An underrated green flag is when someone notices you stressed and quietly handles the small things to lighten your load.

### [TBDM-039]

    To the window, to the wall.
    To my comfy bed I crawl.
    Don't need to hang out with y'all.
    Ah. Sleep, sleep, sleep.

### [TBDM-040]

    Why is 69 afraid of 70? Because they once got in a fight and 71. 70 is rumored to be a cannibal but no one can prove who 78.

### [TBDM-041]

    If you live something,
    Set it on fire.
    If it ... no wait. Is that right?
    Sh*t! I'll be right back.

### [TBDM-042]

    Not being able to teleport is continuing to be a huge inconvenience for me.

### [TBDM-043]

    I just some some idiot at the gym put a water bottle in the Pringles holder on the treadmill.

### [TBDM-044]

    I saw a guy earlier today with no chin. And, seriously, all I could think was, "How does he put on pillow cases?"

### [TBDM-045]

    Does anyone else look in the refrigerator for a snack only to find you have no snack-worthy snacks, then, lower your snack-spectations and eat like on slice of cheese and a random grape?!?

### [TBDM-046]

    It helps if you imaging autocorrect as a tiny little elf in your phone who is trying hard to be helpful, but is in fact quite drunk.

### [TBDM-047]

    Sometimes you have to play the role of a fool to fool the fool why things they are fooling you.

### [TBDM-048]

    If I had a Delorean, I would probably only drive it from time to time.

### [TBDM-049]

    When I was young, I was scared of the dark. Now, when I see our electric bill I am scared of the lights.

### [TBDM-050]

    I just found out that the neighborhood had a meeting about the crazy person on the block. It's strange that they didn't invite me.

### [TBDM-051]

    Be decisive. Right or wrong, make a decision. The road of life is paved with flat squirrels who couldn't make a decision.

### [TBDM-052]

    Tips for folding a fitted sheet:
    1. Tuck one corner inside the other.
    2. Fold in half.
    3. Angrily roll into a ball because it's impossible.
    4. Start drinking ...

### [TBDM-053]

    If you ever hear me cuss and say, "Fu*k it," you'd better stand by my side or run ... because I am about to make some very questionable decisions.

### [TBDM-054]

    You can tell a lot about someone by the coat they wear. If the arms are secured in the buckles, they're fun.

### [TBDM-055]

    I saw a guy today at Starbucks.
    No phone.
    No tablet.
    No laptop.
    He just sat there, drinking coffee, like a psychopath.

### [TBDM-056]

    I just ate what I thought was a feta cheese crumble from my salad that was on my sweatshirt. It turns out it was deodorant. So, how's your day going?

### [TBDM-057]

    I can't decide which pants to wear today: smart or fancy.

### [TBDM-058]

    Instead of a sign that reads, "Do Not Disturb," I need one that says "Already Disturbed. Proceed with Caution."

### [TBDM-059]

    I came, I saw,
    I forgot what I was doing.
    I went back,
    Got distracted,
    And have no idea
    What's going on.
    Is this my cup?
    I have to pee.

### [TBDM-060]

    Never fight until you have to. But, when it's time to fight, fight like you're the third monkey on the ramp to Noah's Ark ... and brother, it's starting to rain.

### [TBDM-061]

    If you think you are smarter than the previous generation, 50 years ago the owner's manual of a car showed you how to adjust the valves. Today, it warns you not to drink the contents of the battery.

### [TBDM-062]

    I was in a meeting earlier where the room number was 404. I joked that I couldn't find the room and nobody understood. This is why I have such a hard time making friends.

### [TBDM-063]

    From my wife ...
    Yesterday: Fixed hair and makeup. Saw no one.
    Today: Looked like Jack Nicholson from The Shining. Saw all the people I know.
    All. Of. Them.

### [TBDM-064]

    Someone tried to tell me that spending hundreds of dollars on a keyboard won't make me a better developer. Can you believe they would like to me like that?
