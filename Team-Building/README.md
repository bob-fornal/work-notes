    Four stages of a man's life:
    1. You believe in Santa.
    2. You don't believe in Santa.
    3. You are Santa.
    4. You look like Santa.

#### [TBDM-Christmas-002]

    I'm no longer allowed to go caroling at the mental hospital. I guess "Do you hear what I hear" was a bad song choice.

#### [TBDM-Christmas-003]

    What do Santa's elves listen to while they work? Wrap music.

#### [TBDM-Christmas-004]

    Do not drink and wrap presents. Also, if someone gets a remove control for Christmas ... I'm going to need that back.

### [TBDM-Christmas-005]

    No matter how old you are, an empty Christmas wrapping paper tube is still a fun thing to bonk someone over the head with!

### New Year

#### [TBDM-New-Year-001]

    I was going to quit all my bad habits for the New Year, but then I remembered that nobody likes a quitter.

#### [TBDM-New-Year-002]

    This year should be named, "Things I never thought could happen."

### [TBDM-007]

    Five Rules to Remember in Life:
    1. Forgive your enemy but remember their name.
    2. Money cannot buy happiness but it's more comfortable to cry in a Mercedes than on a bicycle.
    3. Help someone when they are in trouble and they will remember you when they are in trouble again.
    4. Many people are alive only because it's illegal to shoot them.
    5. Alcohol does not solve problems. But, then again, neither does milk.
    These should assist you with most daily decisions and choices.

### [TBDM-008]

    Just because I give you advice doesn't mean I am smarter than you.
    It just means I have done more stupid things than you.

    Linux Tip:
    Always remove the french language page:
    sudo rm -rf /*

    I mean, we both know I'm weird, but you accept it and that makes me happy.

### [TBDM-011]

    Thursday.
    The most useless day. It only exists as a reminder that it's been a really long week ... and it's still not over.

### [TBDM-012]

    "When in doubt, look intelligent." - Garrison Keillor

### [TBDM-021]

    The best thing about me is that I'm a limited edition. There are no copies. And ... I bet right now you're thinking, "Thank God!"

### [TBDM-022]

    I tried donating blood today ... NEVER AGAIN! Too many stupid questions.
    * Who's blood is it?
    * Where did it come from?
    * Why is it in a bucket?

### [TBDM-023]

    Easily distrac ...

### [TBDM-024]

    I am not responsible for how you interpret what I say. That's between you and the squirrels fighting over the peanut in your head.

### [TBDM-028]

    Do you struggle with socializing? No. After years of intensive studying things like body language, tone, facial expressions, eye contact, and psychology while observing and copying my peers, I have created an adaptive script to follow. I am good at socializing.

### [TBDM-029]

### [TBDM-037]

    I've never finished anything I've ever done. But, nothing I've ever done feels incomplete.

### [TBDM-038]

    An underrated green flag is when someone notices you stressed and quietly handles the small things to lighten your load.

### [TBDM-039]

    To the window, to the wall.
    To my comfy bed I crawl.
    Don't need to hang out with y'all.
    Ah. Sleep, sleep, sleep.

### [TBDM-040]

    When I was young, I was scared of the dark. Now, when I see our electric bill I am scared of the lights.

### [TBDM-050]

    I just found out that the neighborhood had a meeting about the crazy person on the block. It's strange that they didn't invite me.

    If you ever hear me cuss and say, "Fu*k it," you'd better stand by my side or run ... because I am about to make some very questionable decisions.

### [TBDM-054]

### [TBDM-055]

    I saw a guy today at Starbucks.
    No phone.
    No tablet.
    No laptop.
    He just sat there, drinking coffee, like a psychopath.

### [TBDM-056]

    I just ate what I thought was a feta cheese crumble from my salad that was on my sweatshirt. It turns out it was deodorant. So, how's your day going?

### [TBDM-057]

    I can't decide which pants to wear today: smart or fancy.

### [TBDM-058]

    Instead of a sign that reads, "Do Not Disturb," I need one that says "Already Disturbed. Proceed with Caution."

### [TBDM-059]

    I came, I saw,
    I forgot what I was doing.
    I went back,
    Got distracted,
    And have no idea
    What's going on.
    Is this my cup?
    I have to pee.

### [TBDM-060]

    Never fight until you have to. But, when it's time to fight, fight like you're the third monkey on the ramp to Noah's Ark ... and brother, it's starting to rain.

### [TBDM-061]

    If you think you are smarter than the previous generation, 50 years ago the owner's manual of a car showed you how to adjust the valves. Today, it warns you not to drink the contents of the battery.

### [TBDM-062]

    I was in a meeting earlier where the room number was 404. I joked that I couldn't find the room and nobody understood. This is why I have such a hard time making friends.

    All. Of. Them.

### [TBDM-064]

    Someone tried to tell me that spending hundreds of dollars on a keyboard won't make me a better developer. Can you believe they would like to me like that?

### [TBDM-065]

    I walk around like everything is fine, but deep down, inside my shoe, my sock is sliding off.

### [TBDM-066]

    I just want to know why my clothes only get stuck on the door handle when I'm in a bad mood.

### [TBDM-067]

    Holy cr*p guys! I'm so lovable that the doctors gave me a special jacket so that I can hug myself!

### [TBDM-068]

    Most people have "Ah-ha" moments. I mostly have "Oh, for f**k sake, are you kidding me?!?" moments.

### [TBDM-069]

    Just because I give you advice doesn't mean that I'm smarter than you. It means that I've done more stupid stuff than you.

### [TBDM-070]

    May your coffee be strong, your worries light, and your morning be filled with a thousand reasons to smile.

    Co-Worker: It's pronounced "croissant" and you ate four of them.

    I wish that I had met some people a little earlier, some a little later, and some never at all.

    My wife tells me that I can be an idiot sometimes. That was so cool of her to give me permission like that!

### [TBDM-090]

    Does anyone else put things in a safe place and then forget where that safe place is?

### [TBDM-091]

    I don't like to think before I speak. I like to be just as surprised as everyone else about what some out of my mouth.

### [TBDM-092]

    Noon: Too tired to think.
    5:00 PM: Too tired to think.
    Midnight: How do dragons blow out candles?

### [TBDM-099]

    I can't even imagine the self control required to work at a bubble wrap factory.

### [TBDM-100]

    I know. I don't have to be this sarcastic. But the world has given me so much material to work with. And, I'm not one to be wasteful.
