# Mentoring

## Mentee

Three ways to MAXIMIZE what you get from a mentor:


1. **Mindset**: Often, a large ego or negative attitude will limit the benefits you derive from a mentor. Having an open and learning-oriented attitude towards mentorship could help in gaining a lot more from the experience.

2. **Doing the Work**: As much as your mentor guides you, it's imperative to understand that you need to put in the work to see results. Joining a mentorship doesn't guarantee instant success, but your dedication and effort certainly could.

3. **Doing the 'Boring' Work**: The secret to reaching the next level isn't in doing multiple things but in consistently focusing on essential aspects.

The most successful students display some key characteristics:

* Willingness to learn, implement, and take responsibility.
* Effective utilization of resources.
* Engagement with their peers, forming networks, and building relationships.

Joining a mentorship program is just the first step. The journey is filled with learning, implementing, and constantly working towards your goals.
