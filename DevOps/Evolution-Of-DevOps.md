# Evolution of DevOps

* Monolith(s) (to production in 4-6 months).
* Monthly Deliveries (throw code "over the fence to IT/Operations).
* 2007-8: Community discussions, started focused on collaboration and communication.

## Triggered Change

There was a mindset that said **failure** is a learning event, not a blame-game.

### Principles

* Collaboration: Visibility, Alignment, End-to-End Ownership.
* Automation: Reduce human error, Increase productivity, Shorter iteration time, Respond quickly.
* Continuous Integration: Minimize waste, Optimize speed, cost, ease of delivery, Tied to CD.

### Practices

* Agile, CI/CD, Tooling, Automation, Monitoring, Observability, Continuous Feedback, Culture.
* ***Culture Change*** is the most difficult to manage.
