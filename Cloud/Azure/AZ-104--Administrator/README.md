# Azure AZ-104 - Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification

## Training Overview

I am always suggesting that people have a plan. Here's my plan:

1. Training: There's an awesome course I will use.
2. Hands-on: I have access to hands-on material.
3. Practice Tests
4. Take and Pass the Test

I plan to do these four things in order.

* The training should take an estimated 30-days.
* I am not completely sure how long the hands-on will take, but I will assume about 60-120 days.
* Then, I will need 30-days or so to run through the practice tests to get to the level I want.

### Training

I am starting with:

* [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification) on Microsoft Learn.
* [AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification Prep](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/az-104-microsoft-azure-adminstrator-certification-prep/table-of-contents) course on Pluralsight.

### Hands-On

I am starting with:

* [AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://learn.cloudlee.io/p/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator) with James Lee.

### Practice Tests

### Conclusion

The core to my plan, as I said, is to go through all the training (even the parts I already know), then complete the hands-on, then practice until I reach 95-percent every time I am taking the tests.

Then, and only then, will I sit for the test ... my notes (as I go through the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?f=live)) are below.
