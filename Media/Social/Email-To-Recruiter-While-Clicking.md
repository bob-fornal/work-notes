Hello NAME,

I recently saw on your Careers Page the open role of: link the open position here. I am really interested in this position, and I think I am an ideal candidate because of these reasons; 1, 2, 3.

I have completed an online application with the e-mail address of yourname@emaildomain.com (This is an important component, because a lot of times I can pull your application with your e-mail address.). I have also enclosed my resume and cover letter to this e-mail, for your reference.

Are you by chance the Recruiter for this position? If so, I would be excited to connect! If you are not the Recruiter, would you please point me in the right direction, or be willing to let that Recruiter know that I have applied? I am really interested in your company because of X, Y, Z.

I really appreciate your help in advance.

Have a great night.
