# Mac Transfer Notes

1. Adjust for new drive size (old machine).
2. Complete a backup to Time Machine.
3. Disconnect old machine from Time Machine (may need to reboot NAS).

## On new Mac

1. Ensure device OS matches old Mac.
2. Open `Migration Assistant`.
3. Choose transfer `From a Mac, Time Machine, or startup disk`.
4. Select the NAS.
5. Select the Backup to restore.
6. Large transfers might need hours to complete, and might seem to pause occasionally. After Migration Assistant is done, quit Migration Assistant on both computers, then log in to the migrated account on your new Mac.
