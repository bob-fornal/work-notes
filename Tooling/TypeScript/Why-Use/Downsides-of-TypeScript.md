# Downsides of TypeScript

1. Another thing to learn.
2. More code boilerplate, especially for 3rd party libraries.
3. Installation costs, initial time.
4. NPM modules without Type Definition are difficult to work with in TypeScript.
5. It only starts to pay off once the codebase gets larger and complex.
6. The resources are scattered in multiple places.
7. Slower compile and build times.
8. `any` basically disables the type check altogether.
