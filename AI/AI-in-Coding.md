# AI Evolution in Coding

1. General-purpose LLMs (chat assistants)

    Treating general-purpose LLMs like a coding partner: you copied code into ChatGPT, asked why it is wrong, and manually applied the fix. This helped engineers move faster, but the workflow was slow and manual.

2. Coding LLMs (autocompletes)

    Tools like Copilot and Cursor Tab brought AI into the editor. As you type, a coding model suggests the next few tokens and you accept or reject. It speeds up typing, but it cannot handle repo-level tasks.

3. Coding Agents

    Coding agents handle tasks end-to-end. You ask “refactor my code”, and the agent searches the repo, edits multiple files, and iterates until tests pass. This is where most capable tools such as Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex focus today.
