## Description

Goose is an Open-source AI agent that will transform how you work and automate workflows.

AI agents are changing how software gets built. Teams now want engineers who can work with AI agents, design repeatable workflows, and ship faster. In this hands-on session, you'll use goose, an open-source, LLM-agnostic, MCP-native AI agent, to build real projects while stepping into the role of the Winter Festival's newly hired AI Engineer.

## Agents

An AI agent is an autonomous software system that perceives its environment, reasons through information, and takes independent actions using tools to achieve specific, high-level goals with minimal human oversight.
